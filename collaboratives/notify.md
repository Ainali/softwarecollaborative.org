## Description

Notify is a Software-as-a-Service tool, hosted by a central authority, that participating agencies can use to send emails, text messages, and postal letters. Agencies can make an API call to Notify, specifying a message and a recipient, and Notify handles rendering it as an email, text message, or printed letter, and then sending it.

Notify was created by [the UK’s Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service), and they are the only country to deploy it at a wide scale. They make it available to localities, the military, government schools, government health services, and national government agencies.

As a result of this approach, Notify is a sort of collaborative of collaboratives, with each installation of the software serving all members of that particular collaborative.

[Canada](https://notification.canada.ca/) and [Australia](https://notify.gov.au/) digital services host their own versions of Notify for the benefit of their governments. Australia limits the functionality to text messages and emails (not postal letters). [Canada reports](https://notification.canada.ca/activity) that 73 “services” are using Notify, and [Australia reports](https://notify.gov.au/) 238 federal customers, 118 state/territory customers, and 31 local government customers.
