## Description
This 501(c)3 non-profit works to “advance rigorous transportation and land use decision-making for the public good by advocating for and supporting improved travel analysis, and facilitating its implementation,” and they have created a couple of open source software tools to that end. Members include Oregon DOT, San Francisco County Transportation Authority, Ohio DOT, and others.

One channel in which the Zephyr Foundation looks to innovate the transporation sector is through their Zephie Awards, a series of awards that honors those who have made meaningful contributions to travel analysis and transportation. Recipients of the Zephie Awards have strengthened open data sharing, shared tool and visualization development, quality control, and scenario management. 

## Network Data Standard and Management Tools
"Datasets of standardized input and observed data in order to facilitate the testing of and compare the performance of various algorithms, approaches, or parameters."

## Count and Data Management Tool
"Create an online transportation data management tool for travel analysis which tiers from several successful one-off projects that only appeared at single agencies."

## Fast-Trips
"An open-source person-based dynamic transit assignment tool."

## GTFS-ride
"A data standard for fixed-route ridership."
