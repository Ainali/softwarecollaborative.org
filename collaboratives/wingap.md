## Description

WinGAP CAMA is the primary appraisal software used in the State of Georgia property tax appraisal arena, employed by 145 of the 159 counties in Georgia. It is a cooperative effort of the Georgia Department of Revenue and GAP Group Inc., a non-profit organization.

WinGAP is Windows software. Itâ€™s the product of a non-profit organization, Gap Group Inc., with a board comprised of representatives from member counties. Each member county pays $1,500/year to support the maintenance of the software, giving them an annual budget of under $250k.

In 1987, the [Georgia Department of Revenue](https://dor.georgia.gov/) was approached by the [Tennessee Valley Authority](https://www.tva.com/), which proposed to invest money in computer software for the collection of property taxes in northern Georgia (which is part of the Tennessee Valley). After a meeting that included [Georgia's Extension Service](https://extension.uga.edu/), they concluded that they should spend $20,000 toward this. They found a professor at Mississippi State University who had written some similar software, and worked with him to build the Georgia Appraisal Program (GAP). The software was ready in 1989, and put into use in twelve counties.
