## Description
“AASHTOWare is a unique and powerful enterprise software suite designed by transportation professionals for transportation professionals. No other software matches its effectiveness for transportation project design and management. Why? Because no other software is cooperatively developed and continually updated by experts from state transportation agencies across the nation.”

AASHTOWare has a license agreement that members must adhere to. A site license for every tool in the AASHTOWare suite runs $514,000/year.

The AASHTO Cooperative Computer Software Development Program is run by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan association that represents the member highway and transportation departments in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

The software license statement says that some portions of the suite are owned by Infotech, so it is unclear how much of this software is cooperatively owned.
