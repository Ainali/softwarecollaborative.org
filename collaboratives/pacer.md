description: The state courts use their own copy of Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER), the U.S. Supreme Court’s case and docket system. This came about because “the Supreme Court in May 2007 entered an agreement with the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to study feasibility of adapting the federal trial court electronic filing system and related PACER public access system for use in state courts.”
