## Description
An unemployment insurance software consortium that included Idaho, Vermont, Iowa, and North Dakota. Idaho developed the first release. Iowa left the consortium before long due to differing technical requirements, and North Dakota later joined. Nicknamed "iUS," it was dissolved in early 2020, after three years of work. According to Vermont, Idaho was unwilling to give other states any control over iUS, or to open up the source code.
