## Description
A five-state unemployment insurance software consortium, including Mississippi, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Maine, and Connecticut. Only Maine and Mississippi have implemented the platform fully. The software was built and is maintained by Tata Consultancy Services. Each state hosts their own copy of the software.\n\nThere were some significant problems with re-implementation in Maine (https://www.centralmaine.com/2018/03/11/document-maine-agency-botched-unemployment-system-rollout-destroyed-records/), and both Maine and Mississippi have expressed displeasure with Tata (https://bangordailynews.com/2020/09/03/mainefocus/people-are-still-stuck-in-maines-unemployment-vortex-while-multi-state-leaders-havent-met/). Rhode Island intended to move to the system in 2019, but they couldn't get it working correctly, and they continue to use their legacy system.
