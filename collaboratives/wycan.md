# Description
The planning for this Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, North Dakota unemployment insurance software consortium started in 2009, and it was established via a Cooperative Purchasing Governance Agreement. The other states pulled out, and today this "consortium" includes only Wyoming.

Colorado withdrew after mediation with the vendor. It looks like there was talk of moving WyCAN members over to the ReEmployUSA platform.
