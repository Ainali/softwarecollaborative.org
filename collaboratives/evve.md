## Description

EVVE is a product of the [National Association of Public Health Statistics and Information Systems](https://www.naphsis.org), which was formed in 1933, Fifty states, New York City, Washington D.C., and two territories participate (Guam and American Samoa lack electronic birth and death registration). Built atop [State and Territorial Exchange of Vital Events (STEVE)](steve.html), EVVE is funded by user fees.

They say:

>The EVVE system verifies identity quickly and powerfully by matching against United States birth certificate databases. EVVE is the sole source for this capability. No other private or federal database contains this data. In cases where a birth certificate is in hand, EVVE allows for immediate confirmation of the document’s legitimacy.

EVVE has two components. The first is a system that’s only for government employees to use to verify that a paper birth certificate is legitimate. The second is their "Fact of Death" system, which is open to private sector customers. That system can be provided with a list of people, and it will return the subset of the members of that list who are known to be deceased. It does this by sending a real-time query to every participating state and jurisdiction, ensuring thst most up-to-date information. Not all jurisdictions are willing to sell this data to all customers, so some users will get a response from a subset of all jurisdictions in the U.S. EVVE charges per query.
