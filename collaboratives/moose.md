## Description
"“The Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE) is a finite-element, multiphysics framework primarily developed by Idaho National Laboratory. It provides a high-level interface to some of the most sophisticated nonlinear solver technology on the planet.” Created and maintained by Idaho National Laboratory, major contributions have been made by Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, work has been performed by a pair of contractors (Battelle Energy Alliance and Triad National Security), and minor contributions have come from The University of Texas at Austin, Argonne National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
