## Description
Michigan’s MMIS is said to be in use in Illinois as well, but there is lots of coverage of initial efforts in 2013–15, but little coverage of how that turned out. The website for Illinois’ MMIS, which appears to be up-to-date,” says that “rather than developing a new system, Illinois is obtaining a fully-operational, federally-certified MMIS partnership,” implying that they have abandoned their Michigan collaboration, but are seeking to begin a new collaboration.
