description: “OpenFisca is an open source project that allows you to turn legislation into code. Describe your tax & benefit system, provide a situation as input (i.e income), ask for a calculation as output (i.e. income tax), and get your results. [...] Created by France Stratégie (under the prime minister), expanded by Etalab, and later had “new contributors from other French agencies, as well as international reusers with Barcelona joining Tunisia.”
