# Intergovernmental Software Collaboratives

## Introduction

There are many dozens — probably hundreds — of intergovernmental software collaboratives around the world. These organizations take many forms, but what they all have in common is that they bring multiple governments together to collectively contribute to and benefit from custom software. Sometimes they span nations, sometimes states, sometimes municipalities, and sometimes municipalities in the same state. Some collaboratives have all 50 U.S. states as members, some are shared by just two governments. Some of these are going strong after twenty years, others failed after two years.

This inventory is largely U.S.-centric, and limited to those with information available about them in English.
