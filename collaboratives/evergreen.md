## Description

Evergreen is an open-source integrated library system (ILS) created by the Georgia Public Library System in 2006 to support their 275 libraries, with funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. After a 5-year development period, Georgia released it under an open source license, so that it could be used elsewhere. Today it is deployed worldwide in over 2,000 libraries, including a number of U.S. state-level catalogs. The software is maintained by a purpose-created non-profit organization, which pools member contributions to support development. Evergreen runs on a Linux web server and is interacted with via a web browser.

The existence of Evergreen has spawned the creation of many other cooperatives based on it, such as Missouri Evergreen (http://moevergreenlibraries.org/), NC Cardinal (https://statelibrary.ncdcr.gov/ld/nc-cardinal), Evergreen Indiana (https://www.in.gov/library/evergreen.htm), and quite a few others. They provide libraries with catalogs via a statewide Software as a Service (SaaS) model, allowing libraries to have full-featured catalogs without the technical requirements of hosting and maintaining the underlying software.
