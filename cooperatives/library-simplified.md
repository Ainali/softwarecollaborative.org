## Description
This collection of middleware, server software, collections management tools and mobile client applications for iOS and Android is used by libraries to deliver e-books and audiobooks to their patrons. Its creation was funded by a 2012 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and it was first made available to NYPL patrons in 2016. Libraries can implement the open source software themselves, or they can pay [one of the approved service providers](https://librarysimplified.org/service-providers/), who provide the software as a hosted service. [Library Simplified is in use by libraries across the U.S.](https://librarysimplified.org/community/), with particularly robust use in California, Texas, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.
