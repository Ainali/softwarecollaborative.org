## Description

Open Path is a suite of open source software for governments’ Coordinated Access System (CAS) and [Homeless Management Information Systems](https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hmis/) (HMIS), used to collect client-level data and data on the provision of housing and services to homeless individuals and families and persons at risk of homelessness. They’re two complementary tools that are jointly titled “Open Path.”

Open Path was created when [Boston's Department of Neighborhood Development hired Green River](https://www.greenriver.com/portfolio/the-city-of-boston), a Vermont-based software development vendor, to create components of a CAS and HMIS for them. Boston released the resulting software under an open source license, allowing it to be reused freely. [Green River now sells SaaS hosting for Open Path](https://www.openpath.host/how-to-get-it), although any government is also free to use Open Path without hiring Green River.

Both the CAS and the HMIS are written in Ruby.
