## Description

NASBA describes themselves as such:

>Since 1908, NASBA has served as a forum for the nation’s 55 State Boards of Accountancy, which administer the Uniform CPA Examination, license more than 650,000 Certified Public Accountants and regulate the practice of public accountancy in the United States.
>
>NASBA accomplishes its mission of enhancing the effectiveness and advancing the common interests of the Boards of Accountancy by creating innovative avenues for accounting regulators, educators and practitioners alike to address emerging issues relevant to the viability of the accounting profession. NASBA also makes available to member boards a rich portfolio of products and services – all designed to effectively aid Boards of Accountancy in their mission of ensuring public protection. 

About their shared software service, the CPE Audit Service, NASBA says:

>NASBA offers its CPE Audit Service platform to State Boards of Accountancy to use as an automated tool for conducting their audits of licensee compliance with the Continuing Professional Education (CPE) requirements. Eligible boards are participating in the Accountancy Licensee Database (ALD) with licensee data records that are properly linked across state lines. The platform is configured for CPAs to report CPE hours and documentation to the Boards electronically, and State Boards of Accountancy are provided administrative tools for evaluating submitted credits and documentation for compliance with State Board CPE rules and regulations during the audit process.
