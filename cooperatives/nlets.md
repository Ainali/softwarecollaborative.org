## Description

[Nlets describes themselves as such](https://www.nlets.org/about/who-we-are):

> Nlets, is a private not for profit corporation  owned by the States that was created more than 50 years ago by the 50 state law enforcement agencies. The user population is made up of all of the United States and its territories, all Federal agencies with a justice component, selected international agencies, and a variety of strategic partners that serve the law enforcement community-cooperatively exchanging data.

[Nlets describes their work as such](https://www.nlets.org/about/what-we-do):

>Nlets links together and supports every state, local and federal law enforcement, justice and public safety agency for the purposes of sharing and exchanging critical information. [...] Through the Nlets network, law enforcement and criminal justice agencies can access a wide range of information, from standard driver license and vehicle queries to criminal history and Interpol information. The array of services we provide is constantly expanding as we strive to meet the growing demands for information by the agencies that protect life and liberty.
