# Software Sharing Models

_These are the different ways that software can be shared between governments._

## Collaborative, Independent Development
Multiple stakeholder agencies work together (either informally or with an MOU) on development from the start, with each agency contributing in the form of staff/contractor time. This may be reused as SaaS or as executables/source code.

Example: [ReEmployUSA](cooperatives/reemployusa.html)

## Collaborative Organizational Development
Multiple agencies are members of an organization, and that organization performs development work via direct hires or contracting. Those agencies may contribute financially or there may be external funding (e.g., from a higher level of government or from a foundation). The organization may have been created expressly for the purpose of this software collaboration, or it may be an existing organization. In this scenario, software may be reused as SaaS or as executables/source code.

Example: [Digital Towpath](cooperatives/digital-towpath.html), [Association of Oregon Counties’ Integrated Road Information System](cooperatives/oregon-iris.html)

## Collaborative Organizational Licensing
Multiple agencies are members of an organization, and that organization licenses software for all members to use. Those agencies may contribute financially or there may be external funding (e.g., from a higher level of government or from a foundation). The organization may have been created expressly for the purpose of this software collaboration, or it may be an existing organization. 

Example: [CalWIN Consortium](cooperatives/calwin.html)

## Built Here, Others Use
An agency builds software and releases the software or source code publicly, and other agencies then use that software. The software continues to be housed by the original agency.

Example: [Notify](cooperatives/notify.html)

## Built Here, Others Contribute
An agency builds software and releases the source code publicly, and employees of other agencies contribute their modifications. It may continue to be housed by the original agency, or it may transition out to be community supported.

Example: [OpenTripPlanner](cooperatives/opentripplanner.html)

## Built Externally, Agencies Contribute
Open source software exists — not as a creation of government — but it is sufficiently valuable to government agencies that they contribute to its development.

Example: [QGIS](cooperatives/qgis.html)

## Top-Down
A parent government builds software and shares it with child governments (e.g., a state provides it to counties) as SaaS or as executables/source code.

Examples: [Rhode Island E-Permitting](cooperatives/rispi.html)

## Built Open, Then Privatized
An agency builds software that is in the public domain, a private organization takes it over and redistributes it, other agencies then purchase/reuse it via that private organization.

Example: [SQLite](cooperatives/sqlite.html), [CONSUL](cooperatives/consul.html)

## Built Commercialized
An agency hires a vendor to build custom software for them, but the vendor retains copyright. The vendor then resells the software to other agencies, who may not be aware that the software was built for another state.

Example: so many, e.g. state child welfare systems (SACWIS/CCWIS) and Medicaid systems (MMIS)
